# ðŸ”’ 8-Bit Digital Lock

An HDL-based digital lock system that verifies an 8-bit key. Grants access on correct input and triggers lock/alarm on mismatch.  

---

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- 8-bit password-based lock system  
- Verifies user input against a preset key  
- Access granted on correct input  
- Alarm/lock signal on incorrect attempts  
- Implemented in Verilog, synthesizable on FPGA  

---

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- **HDL:** HDL Verilog  
- **Tools:** ModelSim / Xilinx ISE / Vivado (for simulation & synthesis)  
- **Target Hardware:** FPGA boards (any supporting Verilog).
